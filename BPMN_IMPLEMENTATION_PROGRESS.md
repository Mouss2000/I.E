# BPMN remediation implementation

User approved the full prioritized audit roadmap. Work remains active until implementation, verification and deployment complete.

Confirmed business decisions:
- Express J+2 surcharge: 30%, calculated server-side per case.
- J+1: manual laboratory urgency quote required before production.
- Monthly statements: cases delivered during that month, Africa/Casablanca calendar.

Implemented in source, not yet fully verified:
- Public opaque hashed session tokens, password login, courier accounts, SQL login throttling, session revocation.
- Generated ignored persistent signing key; one-time missing-account passwords in ignored `.runtime/bootstrap-credentials.json` (never print or commit contents).
- Explicit tenant membership and workstation permission checks; frontend password login updated.
- Tooth-level clinical evidence, private uploads, inspections, design review/pause clock, production lots, linked measured rework, QR custody and PIN commands.
- Central source transition invariants, status versions and deferred PostgreSQL audit completeness enforcement.
- Durable cache invalidation plus database read generation; paginated case API.
- Delivery-month statement periods, immutable invoices, disputes, credits, real ReportLab PDFs and configurable email/WhatsApp adapters.
- External delivery remains disabled by default. Do not send real messages during tests or deployment checks.
- New statement/financial materialized view definitions and operational outbox/message views.

Pending:
- Finish remaining validation/consistency details, ensure migration graph and PostgreSQL functions run correctly.
- Dedicated BPMN acceptance suite added: checkpoint run 13 tests passed. Frontend lint/build passed (one lint warning). Update previous tests to the secure API contract while preserving their original mechanism coverage.
- Complete frontend workflow, stock movement, doctor actions and catalog-backed financial UI.
- Provision least-privileged runtime database role separately from migration owner; update native/Docker settings safely, without printing secrets.
- Full backend tests, frontend lint/build, migrations for labo1–labo3, rebuilt Celery images and live disposable-tenant smoke test.
- Refresh Graphify and document setup/configuration and any external-service prerequisites.

Current deployment state: only public customers migration 0004 has been applied during this remediation. Private migrations 0021–0023 are new and not applied. Existing Docker worker/Beat still use previous images. Do not start native web/frontend unless needed for verification. No Git commit/push requested.

Handoff snapshot: see `MODEL_HANDOFF.md` for authoritative current status and remaining work; see `OTHER_PC_SETUP.md` for transferring the source checkpoint, database and private files to another Windows PC. User authorized a checkpoint commit/push on `feat/labo-config-and-ui` for this transfer.
